"Customer Experience (CX) Data Analyst\nEvoke is a marketing and advertising agency servicing the healthcare industry. We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, consistently delivering unparalleled levels of strategic, creative, and technological innovation that build richer and more effective interactions between our clients and their customers.\nThe Importance of CX & Data Analytics\nCX is a customers’ holistic perception of their experience of a brand. This perception is made up by every interaction a customer has with the brand, from navigating the website, to making a purchase, to engaging with customer service, and even to the delivery of the product itself.\nAt Evoke, we believe that in order to fundamentally make health more human, we have to understand the CX. We have to understand the journeys of each core customer, looking for moments of friction, moments of frustration or moments where expectations are not met. By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX.\nEvoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations. The macro data enables us to substantiate findings in the CX as well as generate new ways to understand human behavior.\nTo help us accomplish this we are looking to add a full-time CX Data Analyst to the team here at Evoke. The ideal hire should have strong skills across all aspects of data analytics and research, including mining, cleaning, clustering, analysis, and visualization. The candidate should also showcase ease of conveying complex data into readable, goal-oriented outputs.\nJob Description\nAt Evoke, the CX Data Analyst anchors the research to a scientific methodology, but continuously creates new ways to analyze the data. The role is not a copy-paste-print-present type of position, where the same report needs to be refreshed every quarter. Instead, the Evoke CX Data Analyst is challenged with Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Key Business Questions (KBQs), Audience Behavior, and much more. It’s this versatile breath of analysis that requires someone who’s willing to continuously explore, experiment, and learn, yet deliver a project on time while taking ownership.\nThe CX Data Analyst would predominantly be working with text-based data, analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points to arrive at linguistic findings. These insights will often align against KBQs provided by CX Strategy and other team-members. Therefore, the CX Data Analyst needs to have a strong collaborative nature and enjoy teaming up on projects so that it may reach its full potential. The CX Data Analyst should always want to go “one level deeper” asking “Why did the consumer do that?” or “Why does the consumer thing this?”\nThe CX Data Analyst will join a small team that has experienced strong growth providing research and solutions across a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease states.\nSpecific duties include:\nWork directly with other team-members (most often CX Strategy) to conduct Linguistic Analysis and NLP Research across Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Competitive Gap Analysis, Search Behavior Summary Social Media Listening, New Business Pitch Support etc.\nExecute data mining, identifying optimal data sources, extracting data, connect to APIs or building data scrapers\nExecute data cleaning, understanding best practices, and leverage Python to pre-processes for analysis\nExecute data clustering across different data sources to combine a more robust dataset\nExecute data clustering against specific rules to establish relevant subsets of data\nExecute data analysis using several research techniques with a focus on NLP (examples below):\nTop volume across clustered search terms\nTop volume across topics/terms/n-grams/sentiment/emojis used on social\nTop sources of influence across channels, forums, blogs, news, SERP, accounts, products etc.\nLongitudinal content relevance\nAudience language analysis\nExecute data visualization across Excel and Python leveraging packages such as Seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh or others\nCraft a story from the data, conveying complex insights in simple visuals and communicate the takeaways with ease\nHelp develop new research offerings and outside the box solutions for both internal and external purposes\nContinuously consider automation and optimization across current research streams and projects\nKeep current on best practices for data analytics; emerging trends, channels, technologies, platforms, and partners; and innovative programs and approaches\nSkills / Qualifications:\n2+ years in data analytics, specifically working with text-based data (search, social, reviews, news, transcripts, white papers, articles, excerpts etc.)\n1+ years of agency experience preferred, but not required\nHealthcare/pharmaceutical marketing preferred, but not required\nPython proficiency required\nExperience mining, cleansing, clustering, analyzing and visualizing data\nHands-on experience with web analytics platforms, social media listening tools, and search tools such as NetBase, Quid, Crimson Hexagon, Google Keyword Planner, SEMRush, GA etc.\nExcellent written communication, verbal communication, and presentation skills\nProficiency in Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, PPT etc.\nWillingness to learn new tools, code and software\nMust be willing to travel up to 10%\nBA/BS Degree (preferably in Computer Science, Economics, Statistics or Business Administration)\nDemonstrate skills in adaptability, attention to detail, problem-solving, decision making, customer service, interpersonal relations, problem solving, project management, quality management, teamwork, presentations, results oriented, strategic thinker and team building\nAdditional Skills/Qualifications (Not Required but Highly Valuable):\nData analysis and research experience with:\nCall Center Data\nSEO/SEM\nScattertext\nTopic Modeling (LDA)\nCX Journey Mapping\nStatistical & Predictive Modeling\nGPT-3 or Neural Networks (RNN)\nAI/ML image & video recognition\nAI/ML classification best practices\nSQL\nTableau"

"Customer Experience (CX) Data Analyst\nEvoke is a marketing and advertising agency servicing the healthcare industry. We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, consistently delivering unparalleled levels of strategic, creative, and technological innovation that build richer and more effective interactions between our clients and their customers.\nThe Importance of CX & Data Analytics\nCX is a customers\' holistic perception of their experience of a brand. This perception is made up by every interaction a customer has with the brand, from navigating the website, to making a purchase, to engaging with customer service, and even to the delivery of the product itself.\nAt Evoke, we believe that in order to fundamentally make health more human, we have to understand the CX. We have to understand the journeys of each core customer, looking for moments of friction, moments of frustration or moments where expectations are not met. By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX.\nEvoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations. The macro data enables us to substantiate findings in the CX as well as generate new ways to understand human behavior.\nTo help us accomplish this we are looking to add a full-time CX Data Analyst to the team here at Evoke. The ideal hire should have strong skills across all aspects of data analytics and research, including mining, cleaning, clustering, analysis, and visualization. The candidate should also showcase ease of conveying complex data into readable, goal-oriented outputs.\nJob Description\nAt Evoke, the CX Data Analyst anchors the research to a scientific methodology, but continuously creates new ways to analyze the data. The role is not a copy-paste-print-present type of position, where the same report needs to be refreshed every quarter. Instead, the Evoke CX Data Analyst is challenged with Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Key Business Questions (KBQs), Audience Behavior, and much more. It\'s this versatile breath of analysis that requires someone who\'s willing to continuously explore, experiment, and learn, yet deliver a project on time while taking ownership.\nThe CX Data Analyst would predominantly be working with text-based data, analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points to arrive at linguistic findings.

Because when you invest with courage, when you invest with clarity, and when you invest with care, you can get so much more in return. We invest with purpose – and that’s how we’ve become a global market leader. Here, we grow by doing the right thing for the people we serve. And so can you.\nWe want to make success accessible to everyone. This is our opportunity. Let’s make it count.\nInclusion Statement\nVanguard’s continued commitment to diversity and inclusion is firmly rooted in our culture. Every decision we make to best serve our clients, crew (internally employees are referred to as crew), and communities is guided by one simple statement: “Do the right thing.”\nWe believe that a critical aspect of doing the right thing requires building diverse, inclusive, and highly effective teams of individuals who are as unique as the clients they serve. We empower our crew to contribute their distinct strengths to achieving Vanguard’s core purpose through our values.\nWhen all crew members feel valued and included, our ability to collaborate and innovate is amplified, and we are united in delivering on Vanguard's core purpose.\nOur core purpose: To take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.\nFuture of Work\nDuring the pandemic, we transitioned to a work from home model for the majority of our crew and we continue to interview, hire, and on-board future crew remotely.\nAs we have developed the path forward, we have taken a thoughtful approach that both maximizes the advantages of working remotely and the many benefits of coming together and collaborating in a shared workspace. We believe that in-person interactions among our crew are important for preserving our unique culture and advantageous for the personal development of our crew.\nWhen our Crew return to the office, many will work in our hybrid model. A smaller proportion of our crew will operate in the Work from Home work model (for example, field sales crew); or in the Work from Office model (for example, portfolio managers).\nThe working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process – please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into.

By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX.\nEvoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations. The macro data enables us to substantiate findings in the CX as well as generate new ways to understand human behavior.\nTo help us accomplish this we are looking to add a full-time CX Data Analyst to the team here at Evoke.

These insights will often align against KBQs provided by CX Strategy and other team-members. Therefore, the CX Data Analyst needs to have a strong collaborative nature and enjoy teaming up on projects so that it may reach its full potential. The CX Data Analyst should always want to go ""one level deeper"" asking ""Why did the consumer do that?"" or ""Why does the consumer thing this?""\nThe CX Data Analyst will join a small team that has experienced strong growth providing research and solutions across a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease states.\nSpecific duties include:\nWork directly with other team-members (most often CX Strategy) to conduct Linguistic Analysis and NLP Research across Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Competitive Gap Analysis, Search Behavior Summary Social Media Listening, New Business Pitch Support etc.\nExecute data mining, identifying optimal data sources, extracting data, connect to APIs or building data scrapers\nExecute data cleaning, understanding best practices, and leverage Python to pre-processes for analysis\nExecute data clustering across different data sources to combine a more robust dataset\nExecute data clustering against specific rules to establish relevant subsets of data\nExecute data analysis using several research techniques with a focus on NLP (examples below):\nTop volume across clustered search terms\nTop volume across topics/terms/n-grams/sentiment/emojis used on social\nTop sources of influence across channels, forums, blogs, news, SERP, accounts, products etc.\nLongitudinal content relevance\nAudience language analysis\nExecute data visualization across Excel and Python leveraging packages such as Seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh or others\nCraft a story from the data, conveying complex insights in simple visuals and communicate the takeaways with ease\nHelp develop new research offerings and outside the box solutions for both internal and external purposes\nContinuously consider automation and optimization across current research streams and projects\nKeep current on best practices for data analytics; emerging trends, channels, technologies, platforms, and partners; and innovative programs and approaches\nSkills / Qualifications:\n2+ years in data analytics, specifically working with text-based data (search, social, reviews, news, transcripts, white papers, articles, excerpts etc.)\n1+ years of agency experience preferred, but not required\nHealthcare/pharmaceutical marketing preferred, but not required\nPython proficiency required\nExperience mining, cleansing, clustering, analyzing and visualizing data\nHands-on experience with web analytics platforms, social media listening tools, and search tools such as NetBase, Quid, Crimson Hexagon, Google Keyword Planner, SEMRush, GA etc.\nExcellent written communication, verbal communication, and presentation skills\nProficiency in Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, PPT etc.\nWillingness to learn new tools, code and software\nMust be willing to travel up to 10%\nBA/BS Degree (preferably in Computer Science, Economics, Statistics or Business Administration)\nDemonstrate skills in adaptability, attention to detail, problem-solving, decision making, customer service, interpersonal relations, problem solving, project management, quality management, teamwork, presentations, results oriented, strategic thinker and team building\nAdditional Skills/Qualifications (Not Required but Highly Valuable):\nData analysis and research experience with:\nCall Center Data\nSEO/SEM\nScattertext\nTopic Modeling (LDA)\nCX Journey Mapping\nStatistical & Predictive Modeling\nGPT-3 or Neural Networks (RNN)\nAI/ML image & video recognition\nAI/ML classification best practices\nSQL\nTableau"

"Customer Experience (CX) Data Analyst\nEvoke is a marketing and advertising agency servicing the healthcare industry. We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, consistently delivering unparalleled levels of strategic, creative, and technological innovation that build richer and more effective interactions between our clients and their customers.\nThe Importance of CX & Data Analytics\nCX is a customers’ holistic perception of their experience of a brand. This perception is made up by every interaction a customer has with the brand, from navigating the website, to making a purchase, to engaging with customer service, and even to the delivery of the product itself.\nAt Evoke, we believe that in order to fundamentally make health more human, we have to understand the CX. We have to understand the journeys of each core customer, looking for moments of friction, moments of frustration or moments where expectations are not met. By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX.\nEvoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations.

These insights will often align against KBQs provided by CX Strategy and other team-members. Therefore, the CX Data Analyst needs to have a strong collaborative nature and enjoy teaming up on projects so that it may reach its full potential. The CX Data Analyst should always want to go “one level deeper” asking “Why did the consumer do that?” or “Why does the consumer thing this?”\nThe CX Data Analyst will join a small team that has experienced strong growth providing research and solutions across a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease states.\nSpecific duties include:\nWork directly with other team-members (most often CX Strategy) to conduct Linguistic Analysis and NLP Research across Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Competitive Gap Analysis, Search Behavior Summary Social Media Listening, New Business Pitch Support etc.\nExecute data mining, identifying optimal data sources, extracting data, connect to APIs or building data scrapers\nExecute data cleaning, understanding best practices, and leverage Python to pre-processes for analysis\nExecute data clustering across different data sources to combine a more robust dataset\nExecute data clustering against specific rules to establish relevant subsets of data\nExecute data analysis using several research techniques with a focus on NLP (examples below):\nTop volume across clustered search terms\nTop volume across topics/terms/n-grams/sentiment/emojis used on social\nTop sources of influence across channels, forums, blogs, news, SERP, accounts, products etc.\nLongitudinal content relevance\nAudience language analysis\nExecute data visualization across Excel and Python leveraging packages such as Seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh or others\nCraft a story from the data, conveying complex insights in simple visuals and communicate the takeaways with ease\nHelp develop new research offerings and outside the box solutions for both internal and external purposes\nContinuously consider automation and optimization across current research streams and projects\nKeep current on best practices for data analytics; emerging trends, channels, technologies, platforms, and partners; and innovative programs and approaches\nSkills / Qualifications:\n2+ years in data analytics, specifically working with text-based data (search, social, reviews, news, transcripts, white papers, articles, excerpts etc.)\n1+ years of agency experience preferred, but not required\nHealthcare/pharmaceutical marketing preferred, but not required\nPython proficiency required\nExperience mining, cleansing, clustering, analyzing and visualizing data\nHands-on experience with web analytics platforms, social media listening tools, and search tools such as NetBase, Quid, Crimson Hexagon, Google Keyword Planner, SEMRush, GA etc.\nExcellent written communication, verbal communication, and presentation skills\nProficiency in Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, PPT etc.\nWillingness to learn new tools, code and software\nMust be willing to travel up to 10%\nBA/BS Degree (preferably in Computer Science, Economics, Statistics or Business Administration)\nDemonstrate skills in adaptability, attention to detail, problem-solving, decision making, customer service, interpersonal relations, problem solving, project management, quality management, teamwork, presentations, results oriented, strategic thinker and team building\nAdditional Skills/Qualifications (Not Required but Highly Valuable):\nData analysis and research experience with:\nCall Center Data\nSEO/SEM\nScattertext\nTopic Modeling (LDA)\nCX Journey Mapping\nStatistical & Predictive Modeling\nGPT-3 or Neural Networks (RNN)\nAI/ML image & video recognition\nAI/ML classification best practices\nSQL\nTableau"

"Tia was born from the realization that the healthcare system is missing just that: a system enabling health & wellbeing. Tia is the answer to the dehumanizing experiences that women of all backgrounds face navigating the healthcare system. We are rethinking the model of healthcare from the ground up – really asking: what does it mean to have a relationship with your care provider? What does it mean to think about your health every day? How can we get back to the basics and also leverage the cutting edge research in women\'s preventive care? Tia is on a mission to define answers to these questions through building a whole new, distinctly female model of care.\n\nWe are on a mission to enable every female to achieve their own definition of optimal health through science-backed information, access to high-quality care, and community.\n\nWe opened our first clinic in 2019 in NYC, with more to follow in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco this year. Combining virtual and in-person visits, an unwavering commitment to care and accessibility, substantial growth capital and an incredible mission, Tia is poised for rapid growth over the coming years and is building out a world class team to support this expansion.\n\nTia is building a culture of excellence — in people, process and product. This is our northstar value;\n\nWhat is excellence, exactly?\n\nExcellence about constantly elevating yourself, it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities, and identifying your top potential through constant learning, experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection, as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead, in our terms, excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We\'re looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records, and organizational records.\nWe practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia\'s highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear, specifically:\nA drive to constantly improve through experimentation, reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way, we\'re energized by the possibility of invention, innovation, and iteration\nBeing present in and grateful for the journey — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)\nAsking why, then why again — because accepting ""this is just the way it is"" is not good enough\nGrit & perseverance — a maker mentality that involves ""rolling up your sleeves"", but also deep care for oneself and for others\nA commitment to uncovering talents to unlock ""rock star"" potential across every individual\nFurthermore, excellence reflects the ""bigness"" and the ""boldness"" of Tia\'s mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health, as defined by herself.\n\nSaid another way, Tia\'s mission is NOT to make healthcare incrementally better for women. Instead, we\'ve intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women\'s healthcare that\'s truly excellent. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a ""one and done."" We have not and will not ""get it right"" with the first swing. Rather, this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully ""achieve."" By design, we will never be ""done"" with this work, but instead, we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey, not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.\nJob Description\nWe are looking for a highly driven, product-oriented engineer eager to join an early stage team. Your primary responsibilities will include architecting, implementing, releasing and supporting features that enable our collaborative care model. You\'ll work side by side with product owners, designers, and engineers to synthesize technical solutions from product requirements that deliver high impact for our customers and business.

You love to teach and learn from your teammates and celebrate team successes\nWhy You\'ll Love Working at Tia:\nYou\'ll work with a small team of supportive, brilliant engineers like yourself, delivering new products continuously\nYour success will be visible and your work will impact the lives of our internal care team and patients\nYou\'ll use creativity to solve novel problems and be encouraged to learn new technologies to meet our business goals\nYou\'ll have a key role in shaping our engineering culture - from your team\'s technology choices to how we celebrate team wins\nYou will have dedicated career growth support from your manager who has both strong technical and people management experience\nBenefits\nUnlimited vacation\nFree Tia membership\nCompetitive stock option package\n$300 one-time WFH stipend\n$50/month phone and internet reimbursement\nMedical, dental, and vision benefits\n401k program (no matching at this time)\nTop of the line 15"" Macbook Pro\nTravel stipend for team off-sites\nTech Stack\nNodeJS • Typescript • React• Express • ES6 • PostgreSQL • Redis • AWS • ECS • Lambda • Docker • Cloudformation • Git\n\nThis position may require attendance at company and team off-sites and is subject the Company\'s vaccine requirement, as permitted by law and subject to reasonable accommodation.\nTia is an equal opportunity employer.

(“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n$2.4B Annual Revenue\n600,000 Directly Served Business Clients\n2.6B+ Transactions per Year\n8,400+ Employees\n(as of December 31, 2020)\n\nOur payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.\n\nFLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:\nForbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista\nForbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!\nFortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872\nS&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)\nOur Vision\n\nDespite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.\n\nOur Mission\n\nFLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nFLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:\nMore Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.\nMore Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:\nOur Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.\nOur Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.\nFor our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.\nMore Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.\nOur Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging\n\nTogether we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by:\nWelcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;\nEmpowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and\nValuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.\nEmbracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.\n\nOur Values\n\nFLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values:\nInnovation: Figure out a better way\nExecution: Get it done quickly\nIntegrity: Do the right thing\nPeople: We make the difference\nCollaboration: Accomplish more together\nThese values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”\n\nOur values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.\n\nWe strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives.\n\nFLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:\nDue to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.\n\nEqual Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer:\nFLEETCOR is an Equal Opportunity Employer. FLEETCOR provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, gender (including pregnancy), religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, language, ancestry, genetic information, veteran and/or military status or any other group status protected by federal or local law.
